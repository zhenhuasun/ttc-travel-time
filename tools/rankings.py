"""Rankings read straight from the official timetables (GTFS), tram and metro only, no travel-time model.

Published on the site: most served station, peak frequency, longest line, trips per day, last Saturday-night
passage at the centre. Night trips are encoded differently by each operator (25:30 on the day before or 01:30 on the
day after): times are read over a transport day from 3:30 to 3:30, across the neighbouring service days.

Usage: python3 tools/rankings.py [city …]   (writes sources/rankings.json and prints a summary)

For each city, on the reference weekday chosen by build_data.py (a plain school-term Tuesday or Thursday)
and on the following Saturday:
- first and last passage at the centre of the map (weekday), last passage there on Saturday night;
- the most served station (tram/metro passages on the weekday);
- per line, passages between 8 and 9 am at its busiest stop, in the busiest direction;
- per line, scheduled time from one end to the other on its most common trip pattern;
- number of tram/metro trips on the weekday.
